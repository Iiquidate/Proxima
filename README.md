# Proxima

A location-aware messaging platform designed to facilitate local connection and passive networking among students. Proxima enables users to discover and join digital chat channels that are physically anchored to specific GPS coordinates: campus libraries, lecture halls, study lounges, or even social get-togethers.

Built with **React Native (Expo)**, **Express**, **Socket.io**, **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**, and **Supabase Auth**.

## Features

### Location-Based Channel Discovery
- Channels are anchored to real GPS coordinates with a configurable radius in meters
- Users only see and can join channels when they are physically within range
- Uses PostGIS `ST_DWithin` spatial queries for efficient geofencing
- GPS tracking updates every 10 seconds with a 10-meter distance threshold

### Official & Community Channels
- **Official channels** are created by admins at known campus locations (libraries, dining halls, rec centers, etc.) with pre-mapped coordinates and images
- **Community channels** are user-created and anchored to the creator's current GPS location
- Each channel has a customizable radius defining its geographic reach

### Real-Time Messaging
- Powered by Socket.io for instant message delivery
- Messages persist in PostgreSQL and are loaded as history when entering a channel
- Users see sender usernames and admin badges in chat


### Public & Private Channels
- **Public channels** are visible to all users within range
- **Private channels** are only visible to the creator and invited members
- Channel owners can add and remove members from private channels via a dedicated management screen

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Members** can create community channels, delete their own channels, and chat
- **Admins** can create official channels with custom coordinates, delete any channel, and delete any message (via long press)

### Channel Info & Maps Integration
- Swipe right on any channel to view its info card with image, type, and zone radius
- "Open in Maps" button launches Apple Maps or Google Maps with the channel's coordinates

### Authentication
- Email/password registration and login via Supabase Auth
- Bearer token validation on all protected endpoints
- User roles stored in PostgreSQL and attached to every authenticated request

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher
- **iOS:** Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) from the App Store.
- **Android:** No team members currently own an Android device. As such, we cannot currently guarantee the project configuration will work as we have no way to verify ourselves.

---

## Getting Started

The backend server and database are already hosted on Render — no server setup required. You just need to install dependencies and start the Expo dev server.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iiquidate/Proxima.git
   cd Proxima
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   npx expo start
   ``` 
   
   Ensure that you see "Using $\color{lightblue}{\textsf{Expo Go}}$"  (You may need to press `s` to switch out of $\color{lightblue}{\textsf{development build}}$).
   
   Scan the QR code generated, navigate to `Expo Go` at the bottom of the web page, and open in Expo Go.
   It is reccomended that you agree to allow Expo to find devices on your local network.
   
   **IMPORTANT:** This app is largely location based. It is vital you allow your location to be shared.

5. **Sharing with others on a different network**

   If someone is not on the same Wi-Fi as you, use tunnel mode instead:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
   This creates a public URL that works from any network. It may prompt you to install `@expo/ngrok` the first time.
   You can also use `--tunnel` if you prefer to run the app on your cellular data.
